The stock presented in this system is human population. There is an inflow of births and and outflow of deaths. The inflow of births is a reinforcing loop, because the more people are born, the population grows. The outflow of deaths is a balancing loop, because the more people die, the growth is reduced and there is balance. If both of these are kept constant, there will be a stable population number. However, there are 2 variables affecting this - fertility and mortality. If fertility is higher than mortality, the reinforcing feedback loop would dominate and the population will increase, but if mortality dominates, the balancing feedback loop overpowers the reinforcing one and the population will decrease.
